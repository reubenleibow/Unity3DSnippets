#How to use

Please not that this is from: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents/tree/master/Assets/Examples/Scripts

Put "LocalNavMeshBuilder" on to an empty gameobject. This will convert it to a region that auto updates the pathfinding area.
Put "NavMeshSourceTag" on to any object that you want to be the obstical, Note: also add to the terrain.

You do not need to bake, or make static or anything.
